/* lPaeesh le pemu mnxit ehess rtnisg! Oh, sorry, that was supposed to 
say: Please help me unmix these strings!

Somehow my strings have all become mixed up; every pair of characters
has been swapped. Help me undo this so I can understand my strings again.
by writing a java program.

Examples
123456
214365

hTsii  s aimex dpus rtni.g
This is a mixed up string.

badce
abcde


**Notes
The length of a string can be odd â€” in this case the last character 
is not altered (as there's nothing to swap it with).
